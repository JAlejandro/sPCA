ScalablePCA
===========

Scalable PCA (sPCA) is a scalable implementation of Principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm on top of Spark. sPCA has been tested on Apache Spark 1.0.0 and Linux OS. It should work with more recent Spark versions with only minor modifications; however, switching to another platform (e.g., Mac) will require recompiling the jars. In the following, we will take you through running PCA on a toy matrix. First, we will use Spark local mode. Running in local model does not require setting up a cluster. Next, we will run PCA on an Amazon EC2 cluster.
